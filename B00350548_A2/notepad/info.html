<center><p>My website is based on the Japanese franchise of Dragon Ball which isnt just a movie series but also a tv series and comic series.
			The page has a simple layout which is made from the html and css with extra features to allow easy manovering around the website. 
			I used my own knowledge plus some extra help from "w3schools" to make this website successful by cooperating my html, css and javascript knowledge with "w3schools".
			I used javascript to create the slideshow at the top of each page to entice the user to be more interested in the webpage and i also used javascript
			to  have thew time and date shown on every page.</p>
			<p>For the security of the website, if i was to upload the website online i would consider SFTP and SSL as SFTP allows me to upload new files and programs without having
			to worry about someone hacking and taking the code during the transfer and SSL to secure the path between the browser and web server. I created back ups of my website files 
			just incase someone was to be able to hack the servers and delete my webpages i could secure the server again and re upload my webpage. The servers should be frequently maintained
			to prevent any attacks or atleast limit them.</p>
			<p>In the future for this webpage i would add in more information  and history details about the dragon ball franchise and also have clips and information on the tv series and comics.
			The theories page and favourite page would be more detailed as the theories page would be updated regulary like a blog about my thoughts and theories about the shows and movies and 
			the favourite page would update every now and then about my opinion on characters. I would allow users to create a login so they can save different files, information and have 
			notifications when the website updates, there will also be a poll for the dragon ball characters where users can vote for their favourite characters.</p>
			</center>

<center><p>each number is for a different page on the tabs that are used to manouver around each page.
			1 = index page = Home. 2 = History page = History. 3 = Movies page = Movies. 4 = Characters page = Characters. 5 = Voice Actors page = Voice Actors. 6 = Theories page = Theories. 
			7 = Favourite Characters page = Favourite.</p>
